## Quick Start Paths
| Goal | Path |
|------|------|
| Run locally | ProjectOverview > Environments > DeploymentGuide (local) |
| Deploy backend to Oracle | DeploymentGuide > OperationsRunbook |
| Configure security | SecurityCompliance > ThreatModel |
| Extend API | API_Overview > Auth > CodeStyle |
| Performance tuning | PerformanceScalability > Observability |

## Existing Legacy / Supplementary Docs
Existing repository docs (kept for historical traceability) are not duplicated but superseded by this structured set where overlap exists.

## Documentation Principles
- Single source of truth
- Versioned via Git (PR-based change control)
- Security & compliance baked in (OWASP ASVS mapping excerpts where relevant)
- Explicit environment separation: dev / staging / production
- Automatable processes: each guide has an "Automation Potential" note
