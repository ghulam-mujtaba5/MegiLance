## 🎯 Showcase Strategy: "The 30/100 Approach"

For FYP 1, the goal is to demonstrate **30% functional core** while presenting the **100% vision**.

-   **The 30% (Live Demo):** Critical paths that *must* work flawlessly (Auth, Dashboard, Project Posting).
-   **The 100% (Vision):** UI placeholders, "Coming Soon" states, and the System Status page showing the full architecture.

*   **Action:** Fill out the form (use dummy data) and submit. Show the success message.

### 5. The Transparency: System Status (Architecture)
*   **Navigate to:** `/status`
*   **Talking Point:** "To track our development progress for FYP 2, we built a live System Status dashboard. This shows exactly which modules are live, in testing, or planned."
