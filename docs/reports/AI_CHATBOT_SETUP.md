# AI Chatbot Setup & Implementation Report

## Overview
The MegiLance AI Chatbot has been fully integrated with the backend and the local AI service. It now supports "0 cost" operation using local models (`distilgpt2` for generation) without requiring external API keys.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. AI Service Integration (`backend/app/services/ai_chatbot.py`)
- Modified the chatbot service to call the local AI service (`http://localhost:8001`) when no rule-based intent is matched.
- Added `_generate_ai_response` method to handle communication with the AI service.
- This ensures that the chatbot can provide dynamic responses even for unknown queries, using the local LLM.

### 2. Frontend Integration (`frontend/app/ai/chatbot/chatbot.tsx`)
- Replaced the mock `setTimeout` response logic with actual API calls to the backend.
- Implemented `startConversation` on component mount to initialize a session.
- Implemented `handleSend` to send user messages to `POST /api/v1/chatbot/{conversation_id}/message`.
- Added error handling and fallback messages.

### 3. Server Startup Script (`start-servers.ps1`)
- Updated the startup script to automatically launch the AI service (`ai/main.py`) alongside the backend and frontend.
- The AI service runs on port `8001`.

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
    ```powershell
    pip install -r ai/requirements.txt
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    cd frontend; npm install; cd ..
    ```

2.  **Start All Servers**:
    Run the updated `start-servers.ps1` script:
    ```powershell
    .\start-servers.ps1
    ```
    This will open three terminal windows:
    - **AI Service**: `http://localhost:8001`
    - **Backend**: `http://localhost:8000`
    - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`

3.  **Access the Chatbot**:
    - Open `http://localhost:3000/ai/chatbot` in your browser.
    - Start chatting! The bot will use rule-based responses for common queries (Greetings, Help, etc.) and the local AI model for other queries.

## "0 Cost" Configuration
- The system is configured to use **local models** by default.
- **Text Generation**: Uses `distilgpt2` (running locally in `ai/main.py`).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` (running locally).
- **No API Keys Required**: You do not need an OpenAI API key or any other paid service.

## Troubleshooting
- **AI Service Not Starting**: Ensure you have Python installed and the requirements in `ai/requirements.txt` are satisfied.
- **Connection Errors**: Check the console logs in the terminal windows. Ensure ports 8000, 8001, and 3000 are free.
- **Slow Responses**: The local AI model runs on your CPU. Response times may vary depending on your hardware.
