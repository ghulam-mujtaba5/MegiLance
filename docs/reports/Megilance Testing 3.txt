(On the Megilance pricing page (https://www.megilance.site/pricing), there is text that reads "Applicable taxes may be added at checkout. Contact us for enterprise solutions." This text is currently positioned behind the pricing boxes, making it invisible to users. Move this entire text line so that it appears below the pricing boxes in the correct visible position on the page. 

1. The text "MOST POPULAR"  box is transparentnow so looks overappinf fill the little box button of most popular with blue colour in background of this text. Aos lines not looks overlapping.

2. The buttons labeled "Join now", "Start for Free", and "Contact sales" need to be properly aligned and positioned within their respective boxes/containers on the same pricing page.

correct all these issues &ensure these elements display correctly within their containers without overflowing or misalignment.
Please review the pricing information on the Megilance website at the provided URLs. https://www.megilance.site/pricing#:~:text=1%25,fee https://www.megilance.site/pricing#:~:text=5%25,fee https://www.megilance.site/pricing#:~:text=3%25  The current fee structure appears to be displayed incorrectly in the pricing boxes. Specifically, the fees shown are 1% for Premium, 3% for Standard, and 5% for Basic. However, these percentages seem to be reversed - the Premium tier should have the lowest fee percentage, while the Basic tier should have the highest fee percentage. Please correct the statistics in the fee boxes so that they accurately reflect the proper fee structure, with Premium showing the lowest rate and Basic showing the highest rate.
