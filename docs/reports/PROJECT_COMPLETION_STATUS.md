## 🔍 Verification

All critical paths have been verified:
1.  **Search:** `api.search.projects` correctly maps frontend filters to backend SQL queries.
2.  **Pagination:** Frontend `page`/`pageSize` correctly translates to backend `limit`/`offset`.
3.  **Data Types:** `skills` field format unified between Search and List endpoints.
4.  **Performance:** Admin user list uses server-side pagination to handle large datasets.

## 💡 Next Steps for Demo

1.  **Data Seeding:** Ensure the database has a mix of users, projects, and proposals to show off the UI.
2.  **User Flows:**
    - **Client:** Post a job -> View in "My Projects" -> See recommendations.
    - **Freelancer:** Search for job -> Submit proposal -> View in Dashboard.
    - **Admin:** View new user/project in Dashboard -> Suspend/Activate user.

The platform is now a cohesive, functioning system ready for presentation.
