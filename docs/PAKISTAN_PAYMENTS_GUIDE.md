Or click "Add Polygon" in MetaMask networks.

#### Step 3: Get USDC on Polygon

GET  /api/pk-payments/providers/{id}         # Provider details

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100.00,
    "provider": "usdc_polygon",
    "description": "Payment for project"
  }'
```

```json

  "amount": 100.00,
  "fee": 0.11,
  "net_amount": 99.89,
  "instructions": "Send 100 USDC to...",
  "block_explorer_url": "https://polygonscan.com/address/0x..."
}
```

---

## Frontend Component

Use the `PakistanPaymentOptions` component:

```tsx
import PakistanPaymentOptions from '@/app/components/PakistanPaymentOptions/PakistanPaymentOptions';

<PakistanPaymentOptions
  amount={100}
  onProviderSelect={(provider) => setSelectedProvider(provider)}
  selectedProvider={selectedProvider}
  onPaymentInitiate={(details) => handlePayment(details)}
/>
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Never share private keys** - MetaMask signs transactions locally
2. **Verify addresses** - Double-check before sending crypto
3. **Use 2FA** - Enable on all payment accounts
4. **Monitor transactions** - Check blockchain explorers
5. **Keep records** - Save transaction IDs for disputes

---

## Recommended Order of Implementation

1. ✅ **USDC on Polygon** - Set up immediately (free, instant)
2. ✅ **JazzCash/EasyPaisa** - For local users who prefer PKR
3. ✅ **Payoneer** - Many freelancers already have it
4. ✅ **AirTM** - Good for PKR to USD conversion
5. ✅ **Wise** - For clients preferring bank transfers
