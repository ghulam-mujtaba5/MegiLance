## Demo Structure

### Part 1: Introduction & Architecture (3 min)

**Script:**
> "Good morning/afternoon. Today I'm presenting MegiLance, a comprehensive freelancing platform that I've built as my final year project. The platform connects clients with freelancers through an intelligent matching system powered by AI.
>
> **Key Achievement:** I successfully migrated the entire system from Oracle database to Turso, a modern cloud-based libSQL database. This migration improved performance, reduced costs, and eliminated 40+ legacy files from the codebase."

**Show:**
1. VSCode with project structure
2. Point out:
   - `backend/` - FastAPI REST API
   - `frontend/` - Next.js application
   - `backend/.env` - Turso configuration
   - `TEST_PLAN_SUMMARY.md` - Testing documentation

**Technical Details to Mention:**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- Frontend: Next.js 16 with TypeScript
- Database: Turso libSQL (cloud-hosted)
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Payments: Stripe integration
- Real-time: WebSocket support

---

### Part 2: Database Migration Achievement (3 min)

**Script:**
> "Let me highlight my major achievement - the Oracle to Turso migration. Oracle was expensive, complex to deploy, and created deployment challenges. I researched alternatives and chose Turso for several reasons:
>
> 1. **Cloud-native:** No local database server needed
> 2. **SQLite-compatible:** Familiar SQL syntax
> 3. **Cost-effective:** Free tier for development
> 4. **Fast:** Built on libSQL with edge replication
>
> The migration involved:
> - Removing 40+ Oracle-specific files
> - Rewriting database connection layer
> - Updating all queries for libSQL
> - Testing all 1381 API endpoints
> - Ensuring data integrity"

**Show:**
1. Backend terminal with Turso connection message:
   ```
   ✅ Turso client connected: libsql://megilance-db-megilance...
   ✅ Database tables created successfully
   ```

2. Open `backend/app/db/session.py` and explain:
   ```python
   # Using libsql_client for Turso connection
   turso_client = libsql_client.create_client(
       url=settings.TURSO_DATABASE_URL,
       auth_token=settings.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
   )
   ```

3. Show `.env` file (hide sensitive tokens):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=libsql://megilance-db-megilance.aws-ap-south-1.turso.io
   ```

## Backup Talking Points

If questions arise:

**"Why Turso over other databases?"**
> "Turso offers SQLite compatibility with cloud hosting. It's fast, cost-effective, and doesn't require managing database servers. The edge replication feature ensures low latency globally."

**"How do you handle security?"**
> "Multiple layers: JWT authentication with expiration, bcrypt password hashing, role-based access control, CORS configuration, and Pydantic input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks."

**"What about scalability?"**
> "The API is stateless, making horizontal scaling straightforward. Turso handles database scaling automatically. WebSocket connections are managed efficiently with a connection manager."

**"Testing strategy?"**
> "Automated API testing with pytest, manual testing via Swagger UI, and end-to-end testing planned. All major user workflows are tested."

**"Deployment plan?"**
> "Backend can deploy to any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean). Frontend deploys to Vercel. Turso database is already cloud-hosted. All environment variables are externalized for easy configuration."
