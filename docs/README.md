# MegiLance Documentation Index

This is the single source of truth for project documentation. Use this index to navigate to canonical docs. Files outside `docs/` that overlap are kept for history but now point back here.

---

## Platform Overview

- Project Requirements & Specification (canonical): `MegiLance-Requirements-and-Specification.md`
- Brand Guidelines (canonical): `MegiLance-Brand-Playbook.md`
- Architecture Diagrams (canonical): `SystemArchitectureDiagrams.md`
- System Construction Plan (canonical): `SystemConstructionPlan.md`
- Deployment Guide (canonical): `DeploymentGuide.md`
- Hybrid Full-Stack Setup (canonical): `HybridFullStackSetup.md`
- Database Design Specs (canonical): `DatabaseDesignSpecs.md`

Notes:
- Historical files with overlapping content have a deprecation banner linking back to these canonical docs.
- Frontend documentation lives within `frontend/` and is indexed below.

## Deprecated or Consolidated Files

These files remain for history/discoverability and now redirect to canonical docs:

- `../DiagramsPreview.md` → `SystemArchitectureDiagrams.md`
- `../MegiLance-Implementation-Plan.md` → `SystemConstructionPlan.md`
- `../MegiLance-Recommended-Stack.md` → `HybridFullStackSetup.md`, `DeploymentGuide.md`

## Contributing to Docs

- Add new documentation under `docs/` and link it here.
- If an external or root-level doc overlaps, add a short banner at the top pointing to the canonical file in `docs/`.
