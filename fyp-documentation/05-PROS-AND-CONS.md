## 9. Recommendation

### For FYP Defense
> **Go in confident but humble.** Your project is above average technically. Acknowledge missing features honestly and focus on what you learned and built. The documentation alone shows maturity.

### For Job Hunting
> **Lead with MegiLance.** It's your strongest project. Prepare to discuss challenges, decisions, and what you'd do differently. Employers value honesty about limitations.

### For Personal Growth
> **Complete what's missing.** Use the next 6 months to add testing, CI/CD, and one major feature (like payments). This turns a good FYP into a great portfolio piece.
