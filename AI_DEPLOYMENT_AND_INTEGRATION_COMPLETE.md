# AI Deployment & Integration Complete

## Overview
We have successfully prepared the AI service for deployment to Hugging Face Spaces and integrated it into the MegiLance frontend. The system now supports both conversational AI (Chatbot) and one-off text generation (Price Estimator) using a unified backend service.

## 1. Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

### Prerequisites
- A Hugging Face account.
- A new Space created on Hugging Face (SDK: Docker).

### Deployment Steps
1.  **Login to Hugging Face CLI** (if not already logged in):
    ```powershell
    huggingface-cli login
    ```
2.  **Run the Deployment Script**:
    We have created a PowerShell script to automate the deployment.
    ```powershell
    .\ai\deploy_to_hf.ps1
    ```
    *Note: You may need to edit the script to set your specific Hugging Face Space URL if it differs from the default.*

### Docker Configuration
- The `ai/Dockerfile` has been updated to use `python:3.10-slim` and install CPU-optimized PyTorch to ensure it runs efficiently within the free tier limits of Hugging Face Spaces.
- It runs the `main_advanced.py` service on port 7860.

## 2. Frontend Integration

### Environment Configuration
- `frontend/.env.local` has been updated:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:7860
  # For production, update this to your Hugging Face Space URL:
  # NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL=https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
  ```

### New Hooks
- **`useAI.ts`**: A new hook for stateless text generation. Used for features like the Price Estimator where we need a single response based on a prompt.
- **`useAIChat.ts`**: The existing hook for stateful conversations. Used for the Chatbot.

### Component Updates
- **Price Estimator (`PriceEstimatorEnhanced.tsx`)**:
  - Now uses `useAI` to generate strategic recommendations based on the project description.
  - Replaced simulated loading with actual AI calls (with a fallback if the description is too short).
- **Chatbot (`ChatbotEnhanced.tsx`)**:
  - Verified to be using `useAIChat` for full conversational capabilities.

## 3. Testing
- **Local Testing**:
  1.  Ensure the AI service is running: `cd ai && python main_advanced.py` (or use the VS Code task).
  2.  Run the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`.
  3.  Visit the Price Estimator and enter a project description > 50 characters to see the AI recommendation.
  4.  Visit the Chatbot to test conversational capabilities.

## Next Steps
- **Production**: After deploying to Hugging Face, update `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL` in your production frontend environment variables.
- **Monitoring**: Check the Hugging Face Space logs to ensure the service starts correctly and handles requests.
