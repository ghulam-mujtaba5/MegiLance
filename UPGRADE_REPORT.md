# MegiLance Upgrade Report

## Overview
This session focused on upgrading the core "Search & Discovery" experiences for both Freelancers and Clients to a "Premium" standard, matching the high quality of the Dashboards and Home page.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Freelancer Portal
- **Portfolio Page**: Refactored from inline Tailwind to the strict 3-file CSS Module system (`*.common.module.css`, `*.light.module.css`, `*.dark.module.css`) for better maintainability and theming.
- **Job Search Page**:
  - Added **Tabs**: "Best Matches", "Most Recent", and "Saved Jobs".
  - Added **Filters**: "Experience Level" and "Project Length".
  - **Premium Job Cards**:
    - Added **AI Match Score** (Sparkles icon).
    - Added **Verified Client Badge** (ShieldCheck icon).
    - Added **Save/Favorite Button** (Heart icon).
    - Improved visual hierarchy and skeleton loading states.
- **Proposals Page**:
  - Upgraded `ProposalCard` to include **Match Score** and **Verified Client** indicators.
  - Improved card styling to match the new design system.

### 2. Client Portal
- **Freelancer Search Page**:
  - Upgraded `FreelancerCard` to match the premium `JobCard` style.
  - Added **AI Match Score** to show relevance to the client's needs.
  - Added **Verified Freelancer Badge**.
  - Added **Save/Shortlist Button**.
  - Updated the grid layout and skeleton states.

### 3. Shared Components
- **JobCard**: Enhanced with new props (`matchScore`, `isVerified`, `clientRating`) and interactive elements.
- **FreelancerCard**: Enhanced with new props (`matchScore`, `isVerified`, `isSaved`) and interactive elements.
- **ProposalCard**: Enhanced with new props (`matchScore`, `isClientVerified`).

## Technical Standards
- All new components strictly follow the **3-File CSS Module System**.
- All interactive elements are **accessible** (aria-labels, keyboard navigation).
- **Mock Data** was enriched to support the new "AI" features (Match Scores) without requiring backend changes yet.

## Conclusion
The platform now has a consistent, high-quality "Premium" feel across all major user flows (Dashboard -> Search -> Proposal/Hiring). The "AI" value proposition is now visible throughout the UI via Match Scores and Smart Recommendations.
