## 1. Project Overview & Current Status

This document outlines the complete structure of the MegiLance application, detailing all pages, portals, and layouts. Its purpose is to serve as a clear and organized roadmap for both development and project management.

**Current Implementation Status:**
The project is in the **frontend development phase**. The core focus is on building out the user-facing portals (Admin, Client, Freelancer) with a premium, investor-grade user experience. Several key components and layouts have been established, but many pages are yet to be implemented.

**Progress Key:**
- `[ ]` - **Not Started:** The page or feature has not been designed or coded.
- `[~]` - **In Progress:** The page or feature is currently being designed or coded.
- `[x]` - **Complete:** The page or feature is fully implemented and polished.

## 2. Layout Strategy: Portal vs. Simple Website

For a sophisticated SaaS platform like MegiLance, a hybrid approach is most suitable.

-   **Simple Navbar Website:** This layout is ideal for the **public-facing marketing and information pages**. It's clean, familiar to new visitors, and optimized for content consumption and lead generation (e.g., Home, About, Blog, Pricing).

-   **Portal Dashboard Layout:** This layout is essential for the **core application used by logged-in users** (Admins, Clients, and Freelancers). It provides a persistent, feature-rich environment necessary for managing complex workflows like projects, payments, and communication. The sidebar allows for efficient navigation between many different tools and screens.

**Decision:** We will implement **both**. Public pages will use the simple website layout, and all authenticated user-specific functionality will be housed within the appropriate portal dashboard layout.
