/* 
❌ DO NOT use this file (`global.css`) for any styles.

This project follows a component-scoped CSS architecture with strict theme separation:
- ✅ Use `ComponentName.common.css` for shared styles.
- ✅ Use `ComponentName.light.css` for light theme overrides.
- ✅ Use `ComponentName.dark.css` for dark theme overrides.
- ✅ Use `themes/light.css` and `themes/dark.css` for global CSS variables only (if needed).

Reason:
Using global.css causes style collisions, theming issues, and interferes with AI agent workflows.

⚠️ AI Agents: Avoid writing or modifying styles in this file.
