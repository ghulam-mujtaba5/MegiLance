## Route Structure

The MegiLance platform uses Next.js App Router with a structured approach to route organization:

├── (portal)/            # Protected portal routes

## Route Groups

The application uses Next.js route groups to organize functionality:

### (auth) Route Group
Contains all authentication-related pages and flows:
- Login and signup flows
- Password reset functionality
- Passwordless authentication

### (main) Route Group
Contains public marketing and informational pages:
- Landing pages
- Blog and content
- Legal and support pages

### (portal) Route Group
Contains protected application pages organized by user role:
- Freelancer-specific routes
- Client-specific routes
- Admin-specific routes
- Shared portal functionality

## Dynamic Routes

Routes with dynamic parameters:

| Route Pattern | Parameter | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| `/blog/[slug]` | slug | Blog post identifier |
| `/freelancer/projects/[id]` | id | Project identifier |
| `/client/projects/[id]` | id | Project identifier |
| `/admin/users/[id]` | id | User identifier |
| `/admin/projects/[id]` | id | Project identifier |
| `/messages/[conversationId]` | conversationId | Message conversation identifier |
| `/freelancer/portfolio/[itemId]` | itemId | Portfolio item identifier |

## Middleware and Protection

Route protection is implemented through:

1. **Authentication Middleware**: Verifies user authentication status
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures users can only access appropriate routes
3. **Route Guarding**: Redirects unauthenticated users to login
4. **Session Management**: Handles user sessions and timeouts

### Protected Routes
- All routes under `(portal)/` require authentication
- Admin routes require admin role
- Client routes require client role or higher
- Freelancer routes require freelancer role or higher

### Public Routes
- All routes under `(main)/` are publicly accessible
- Authentication routes under `(auth)/` are publicly accessible
- Specific exceptions are handled through middleware

## Route Naming Conventions

1. **Kebab-case**: All routes use kebab-case naming (e.g., `/my-profile`)
2. **Descriptive Names**: Route names clearly describe their purpose
3. **Consistent Structure**: Related routes are grouped logically
4. **Role Prefixing**: Portal routes are prefixed with user role when appropriate

## Route Performance

Routes are optimized for:
1. **Fast Loading**: Code splitting and lazy loading
2. **Caching**: Appropriate caching strategies
3. **Preloading**: Strategic link preloading
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Minimized bundle sizes

## Route Testing

All routes should be tested for:
1. **Functionality**: Correct rendering and behavior
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance
3. **Performance**: Loading times and optimization
4. **Security**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile and tablet compatibility

## Route Documentation Updates

This documentation should be updated when:
1. New routes are added
2. Existing routes are modified
3. Route protection levels change
4. API endpoints are updated
5. User roles and permissions are modified

## Future Route Enhancements

Planned route additions:
1. **Mobile App Routes**: Native mobile app specific routes
2. **AI Assistant Routes**: AI-powered functionality routes
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Cryptocurrency and smart contract routes
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed analytics dashboard routes
5. **Marketplace Features**: Enhanced marketplace functionality routes

## Conclusion

The MegiLance routing system is designed to provide a clear, organized, and secure navigation experience for all user types. The route structure supports the platform's complex functionality while maintaining simplicity and performance.
