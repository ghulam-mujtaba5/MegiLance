# MegiLance Frontend

This is the frontend for MegiLance, a next-generation freelance platform powered by AI and blockchain. It is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and follows a strict component-based architecture.

## ⚠️ Core Architecture & Styling Guidelines

These rules are **mandatory** for all developers and AI agents to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

- **No Global CSS:** All styling is scoped to individual components. The global `globals.css` file is intentionally unused.
- **TypeScript is Mandatory:** All new code must be written in TypeScript with full type safety.
- **AI-HINT Comments:** Every file must begin with an `@AI-HINT` comment explaining its purpose. This is crucial for AI-assisted development and automation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## 🎨 Theming System

The MegiLance frontend features a robust, fully implemented theme-switching capability that supports both light and dark modes. The system is designed for consistency, scalability, and ease of use.

### Architecture

- **`next-themes`**: The app uses `next-themes` via `ThemeProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`. Access theme with `useTheme()` from `next-themes` and call `setTheme('light'|'dark')` to toggle.
- **Per-Component CSS Modules**: Every component has three dedicated stylesheets:
  - `Component.common.module.css`: Base styles that are theme-agnostic.
  - `Component.light.module.css`: Styles specific to the light theme.
  - `Component.dark.module.css`: Styles specific to the dark theme.
- **`cn` Utility**: The `cn` utility from `lib/utils` is used to conditionally merge common and theme-specific class names, ensuring a clean and predictable application of styles.

### Applying Themes to Components

When creating or refactoring a component, follow this pattern to ensure it is fully theme-aware:

1.  **Import Dependencies**:

    ```typescript
    import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';
    import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
    import commonStyles from './Component.common.module.css';
    import lightStyles from './Component.light.module.css';
    import darkStyles from './Component.dark.module.css';
    ```

2.  **Access Theme and Styles**:

    ```typescript
    const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme();
    if (!resolvedTheme) return null; // Prevents UI flash before theme is resolved
    const themeStyles = resolvedTheme === 'light' ? lightStyles : darkStyles;
    ```

3.  **Apply Classes to Elements**:

    ```jsx
    <div className={cn(commonStyles.container, themeStyles.container)}>
      <p className={cn(commonStyles.text, themeStyles.text)}>Hello, world!</p>
    </div>
    ```

This pattern has been applied to all major components, creating a pixel-perfect, investor-grade UI that is consistent across the entire application.

## 🔐 Auth Layout: Two-Panel Grid

All authentication pages (`/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) use a robust, accessible two-panel grid with a left branding panel and right form panel.

- Layout defined in each page's `*.common.module.css` using `grid-template-areas`:
  - Mobile: `grid-template-areas: 'form'` (branding hidden)
  - ≥768px: `grid-template-areas: 'brand form'` with columns `5fr 7fr`
  - ≥1280px: columns `1fr 1fr`
- The `AuthBrandingPanel` is wrapped by a local `.brandingSlot` div so the grid controls placement.
- Avoid `width: 100vw`; use `width: 100%` and `min-height: 100svh` to prevent overflow issues.
- Always merge classes from common + theme modules in components: `cn(common[key], theme[key])` so theme styles do not overwrite layout rules. Use `useTheme` from `next-themes` for theme state.

Reference: `app/components/Auth/BrandingPanel/BrandingPanel.tsx` and `app/(auth)/*/*.tsx`.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **/app:** Contains all pages and layouts, following the Next.js App Router structure.
- **/app/components:** Houses the reusable component library, organized by category (atomic, PWA, AI, etc.).
- **/app/contexts:** Includes all React Context providers, such as the `ThemeContext`.
- **/public:** Stores static assets like icons, images, and the `manifest.json`.
- **/styles:** Contains the base font definitions. **No component styles go here.**

---

## 🎨 Component Library

This project uses a component-based approach. All reusable UI elements are located in `/app/components`.

### Atomic Components
- **Button:** A versatile button component with theme support.
- **UserAvatar:** Displays a user's avatar or initials.
- **Table:** A generic table for displaying data.
- **ProgressBar:** A visual progress bar.
- **And more...**

### AI-Powered Components
- **PriceEstimator:** Provides AI-driven price estimations for projects.
- **FreelancerRankVisualizer:** Displays a freelancer's rank and score.
- **SentimentAnalyzer:** Analyzes and shows the sentiment of a given text.
- **ChatbotAgent:** A full-featured chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant.
- **FraudAlertBanner:** A security banner to alert users of potential fraud.

### PWA & Integration
- **InstallAppBanner:** Prompts users to install the application as a PWA.
- **UpdateNotification:** Notifies users when a new version of the app is available.
