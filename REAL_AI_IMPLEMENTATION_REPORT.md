# Real AI Services Implementation Report

## Overview
We have successfully upgraded the MegiLance AI Microservice from mock implementations to **real, production-grade open-source machine learning models**.

## Implemented Models

| Feature | Model | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Embeddings** | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Generates 384-dimensional dense vectors for high-quality semantic search and matching. |
| **Text Generation** | `google/flan-t5-small` | Instruction-tuned model capable of generating proposals, summaries, and creative text. |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | Fast and accurate sentiment classification for feedback and reviews. |

## Changes Made

### 1. AI Service (`ai/`)
- **`ai/requirements.txt`**: Added `sentence-transformers`, `torch` (CPU optimized), and `scikit-learn`.
- **`ai/main.py`**: 
    - Implemented model loading on startup (cached for performance).
    - Created `/ai/embeddings` endpoint using `SentenceTransformer`.
    - Created `/ai/generate` endpoint using Hugging Face `pipeline`.
    - Created `/ai/sentiment` endpoint using Hugging Face `pipeline`.
- **`ai/README.md`**: Added documentation for setup and usage.

### 2. Backend Integration (`backend/`)
- **`backend/app/services/vector_embeddings.py`**: 
    - Removed mock hash-based embedding generation.
    - Integrated `httpx` to call the AI service's `/ai/embeddings` endpoint.
    - Added fallback logic to prevent crashes if the AI service is unavailable.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these changes to your Hugging Face Space:

1. **Get your Hugging Face Write Token**: [Settings > Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```powershell
   python deploy_to_hf.py <YOUR_TOKEN>
   ```
3. **Update Backend Configuration**:
   Ensure your backend (DigitalOcean or local) has the correct `AI_SERVICE_URL` environment variable pointing to your Hugging Face Space (e.g., `https://Megilance-megilance-ai-service.hf.space`).

## Verification
After deployment, you can verify the services:
- **Embeddings**: The matching system will now use semantic similarity instead of random matching.
- **Generation**: Proposal generation will produce coherent text based on the input.
