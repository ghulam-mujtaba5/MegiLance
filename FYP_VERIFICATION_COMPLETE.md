## Fixes Applied During Verification

### 1. ProposalCreate Schema (proposals.py)
```python
# Added missing field
bid_amount: Optional[float] = None
```

### 2. SQL Column Mismatch Fixes
- `u.full_name` → `u.name` (users table uses 'name' not 'full_name')
- `c.total_amount` → `c.amount` (contracts table uses 'amount')

### 3. Contract Creation Schema
- Fixed INSERT to include required columns: contract_amount, platform_fee
- Changed from UUID id to auto-increment integer

### 4. FYP Simple Backend Created
- `fyp_simple.py` - Minimal backend loading only essential routers
- Bypasses Pydantic v2 compatibility issues with full backend
